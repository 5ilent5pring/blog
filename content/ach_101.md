### The Attribution Trap
You see an alert. Valid credentials. Weird time of day. 

Your brain immediately whispers: *"It's a compromised account."* Or maybe: *"It's an insider threat."* Stop. That is your brain being lazy. We call it **Satisficing**—grabbing the first explanation that fits the facts so you can close the ticket and go to lunch. In CTI, this gets people fired and breaches missed.

Richards Heuer (CIA) developed **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** to fix this. The rule is simple: **You don't look for evidence that proves you right. You look for evidence that proves you WRONG.**

### Field Note: The "California" Login
Let's look at a scenario based on real tactics used by **Volt Typhoon** (the Chinese state-sponsored group known for living off the land).

**The Alert:** `GET /api/v1/users/export`
* **Status:** 200 OK
* **User:** `admin_jdoe` (Valid API Key)
* **Source:** 192.168.x.x (Residential ISP, San Jose, CA)
* **Time:** 03:14 AM PST

**The Knee-Jerk Reaction:**
"It's 3 AM in California. John Doe is probably awake and working late. I'll just Slack him to confirm." 
*(If you do this, you might tip off the adversary).*

**The ACH Approach:**
We build a matrix. We test three theories against the hard data.
1.  **H1:** John is working late (Insider/Benign).
2.  **H2:** Access Broker bought the key (Cybercrime).
3.  **H3:** Volt Typhoon via KV-Botnet (APT).

#### The Evidence Matrix

| Artifact | H1: John (Benign) | H2: Broker (Crime) | H3: APT (Volt Typhoon) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Valid API Key** | **+** | **+** | **+** |
| **Residential IP** | **+** | **-** | **+** |
| **User-Agent: curl/7.88** | **-** | **+** | **+** |
| **Session Duration: 4s** | **-** | **-** | **+** |

### The Diagnosis
Look at the **Valid API Key**. It supports *everyone*. In ACH terms, this evidence is trash. It has **zero diagnostic value** because it doesn't help us discriminate between a sysadmin and a state actor.

Now look at the **Residential IP**.
* **H1 (John):** Fits. He's at home.
* **H2 (Crime):** Does not fit. Criminals use Tor, VPNs, or cheap VPS hosting. They rarely have clean, residential IPs in the target's own city.
* **H3 (APT):** **Perfect fit.** Volt Typhoon routes traffic through compromised SOHO routers (Netgear/Cisco) to blend in with local traffic.

**The Kicker:**
The session lasted **4 seconds** and used `curl`. 
John doesn't type that fast. He uses the web UI. 
A criminal broker usually explores manually with Burp Suite.
A script (APT) grabs exactly what it needs and vanishes.

### Final Verdict
If you went with your gut ("It's John"), you missed a nation-state actor tunneling through a compromised router in San Jose. ACH forced us to see that the "boring" evidence (Residential IP) was actually the smoking gun for **H3**.

Don't prove yourself right. Prove yourself wrong.
