### The Problem: Our Brains Cheat
When analysts see a new cyberattack, our brains instantly try to fit the data into a pattern we already know. This is called **Satisficing**—picking the first answer that looks "good enough" rather than the best one.

If you decide early that "It's APT28," you will subconsciously ignore evidence that suggests it's actually a criminal group.

### The Solution: ACH
**Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** is a Structured Analytic Technique (SAT) developed by CIA veteran Richards J. Heuer Jr. It forces you to flip the script: **Don't try to prove your favorite theory right. Try to prove it wrong.**

### The Core Process

1.  **Brainstorm Hypotheses:** List *every* possibility, even the unlikely ones.
    * *H1: Malicious Insider*
    * *H2: Nation-State Actor*
    * *H3: Script Kiddie / Prank*
2.  **List Evidence:** Gather your logs, timestamps, and malware hashes.
3.  **Build the Matrix:** This is the heart of ACH. Cross-reference every piece of evidence against every hypothesis.

### Example Matrix

| Evidence | H1 (Insider) | H2 (Nation-State) | H3 (Script Kiddie) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **E1:** Access at 3 AM Local | **+** | **+** | **+** |
| **E2:** Custom Zero-Day Used | **-** | **+** | **-** |
| **E3:** Data Exfiltrated | **+** | **+** | **-** |

### How to Read This
* **Consistent (+):** The evidence fits the hypothesis.
* **Inconsistent (-):** The evidence contradicts the hypothesis.

**Crucial Lesson:** Look at **E1** (Access at 3 AM). It supports *all* hypotheses. In ACH, this evidence has **zero diagnostic value**. You should discard it because it doesn't help you choose a winner.

**The Winner:** H2 (Nation-State) is the most likely not because it has the most "plus" signs, but because it has the fewest "minus" signs.

### Summary
ACH prevents "confirmation bias" by making you explicitly evaluate the alternatives. In CTI, where attribution is difficult and deception is common, ACH is your safety net against jumping to conclusions.
